The Regulations provide detailed specifications that must be met as food and drink is offered in schools and the accompanying guidance ‘Healthy Eating in Schools’ provides practical advice about how to meet the Regulations. The Regulations and guidance include specifications for and advice on meat provision in schools.As long as the Regulations are being met, it is for local authorities to decide what meals to include on menus and as such the Scottish Government do not routinely monitor school menus. We have not been contacted by parents from Dumfries and Galloway about this matter. If parents do raise concerns about school menus we advise them to provide feedback to their local authority who can take this into account as they develop future menus.",440,461

We have worked to ensure nobody is placed at detriment as a result of their participation in the programme as a vaccinator.It is our expectation that reliance on the temporary measures currently in place will reduce as Health Boards continue with efforts to recruit a sustainable vaccinator workforce.",440,461
Question ref. S6W-00292,https://www.parliament.scot/chamber-and-committees/written-questions-and-answers/question?ref=S6W-00292,"Asked by: Golden, Maurice, North East Sco",To ask the Scottish Government whether support for the development and deployment of carbon capture and storage will continue regardless of any formal support arrangement that ministers agree with the Scottish Green Party.,2021-05-27,2021-06-07,Answered by Michael Math,"The Scottish Government supports the development of carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) as a common whole-system decarbonisation infrastructure with the flexibility to adapt over time to play a central role across the decarbonisation strategies of key sectors such as heat, industry and power. A proven technology, there are more than 50 CCUS facilities worldwide, with an estimated combined capture capacity of 96 million tonnes of CO2 per annum.The Committee on Climate Change describes CCUS as a “necessity, not an option” to achieve net-zero emissions; indeed, the swift development of CCUS as a cornerstone of our energy transition is vital to achieving Scotland’s net zero emissions reduction targets.Scotland is the most cost-effective place to begin CCUS in the UK, with existing oil and gas infrastructure available to repurpose for CO2 transport and storage. The development of CCUS could offer a range of transition opportunities for Scottish oil and gas firms and domestic supply chain companies.We are already supporting efforts to deploy CCUS in Scotland, including through our Emerging Energy Technologies Fund, which will provide £80m over the next five years to support the development of CCUS and negative-emissions technologies. We have also provided funding and policy support to the Acorn CCS project in Aberdeenshire, considered the most advanced CCS project in the UK.",440,461
Question ref.

Weddings, civil partnerships and funerals are of particular importance to people and society and are protected under the European Convention on Human Rights.Wedding receptions and funeral wakes mark the social and personal importance of these protected life events. Additionally, there are very practical reasons why funerals cannot be postponed for any length of time. Therefore, these events have been given particular exemptions within the Levels Table compared to the general guidance on other life events.There are no specific exemptions at this time for birthday parties amongst adults, or gatherings to mark a wedding anniversary or other life event, which remain subject to the general restrictions on people gathering.Therefore, other events such as birthday parties for adults, wedding anniversary celebrations and celebrations after a religious life event should only take place in line with the general rules for meeting others indoors and outdoors.The full guidance on protection levels and what individuals can and cannot do at each level can be viewed here:  Coronavirus (COVID-19) protection levels: what you can do - gov.scot (www.gov.scot) ",440,461

",2021-05-25,2021-06-07,Answered by Michael Math,"When householders contact Home Energy Scotland, they are advised on the range of support schemes available, including whether they may be eligible for grant funded schemes such as Warmer Homes Scotland and the Energy Efficient Scotland: Area Based Schemes, before being directed to the HES loan scheme.Even if funding is not available through these schemes, Home Energy Scotland will offer free and impartial energy efficiency advice on how to keep the home warmer and more affordable to heat. Tariff advice is also offered to ensure that households are on the most cost effective tariff for their circumstances and all callers are offered a benefit check. This is to ensure that, no matter what their income, they are receiving all the support they are entitled to.Earlier this year, we published our draft Heat in Buildings Strategy setting out our ambition to transition 1 million homes to zero emissions heating by 2030 and to ensure all buildings achieve a good level of energy efficiency by 2035. Responses to the public consultation are now being analysed.",440,461

That is why we have commissioned an independent Gateway Review to assess the impact of the pandemic on the go-live date for Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme (DRS).We have no current plans to adopt a ‘stepped’ approach in which certain producers would initially be exempt from obligations under DRS.

In addition, Tourism businesses on Non Domestic Rates have been supported by the Strategic Framework Business Fund. We also launched a £129 million package of business support measures over December and January as part of our short term response to the Scottish Tourism Recovery Taskforce recommendations and followed engagement with industry to target support where it was needed the most. We also invested £14 million in the Hotel Support Programme to secure up to 3,000 jobs in the hotel sector, and through the Pivotal Enterprise Resilience Fund we awarded over £8.9 million to hotels and other accommodation last year – there was no equivalent fund in England.Over the past year we have worked closely with sectoral organisations like the Scottish Tourism Alliance on support for the tourism and hospitality sectors and we will continue to do so. This includes £25 million, which we announced in March, to implement the Phase 1 recommendations of the Scottish Tourism Recovery Taskforce. This fund will support domestic and international marketing to rebuild visitor demand, leadership and skills training, development of a net zero pathway for tourism, and social tourism and days out vouchers.Development of phase 2 recommendations (years 2 through 5) is underway by the Scottish Tourism Emergency Response Group and proposals will be considered by the Scottish Government very shortly.

The Scottish Government is reviewing physical distancing and an announcement on the outcome of this review will be made in June. We cannot pre-empt the outcome of the review to say what the future of physical distancing will be in coming months, however as with all restrictions we do not intend to have physical distancing for any longer than is necessary to control the virus effectively. We have provided more than £140 million of additional funding for culture and heritage since the start of the pandemic. The £185 million business support package announced in December 2020 has allowed us to offer more support to the sector in the shape of new funds and further tranches of previous funds, including additional support for grassroots music venues, museums and galleries, and the events sector. Our support includes the £12.5 million Performing Arts Venue Relief Fund (PAVRF), £15 million for a Culture Organisations and Venues Recovery Fund (COVRF) and £6.2 million support for Grassroots Music Venues.

In addition to this specific funding for culture and heritage, businesses in the sector have also received support from the Third Sector Resilience Fund, Pivotal Enterprises Resilience Fund and the Heritage Emergency Fund.On 11 May the First Minister announced that we will provide additional support for the performing arts sector. This recognises the impact of physical distancing on current activity and the sector’s ability to plan for future activity. The intention is to provide top-ups to previous funds (PAVRF and COVRF) which will be administered by Creative Scotland. Creative Scotland are currently developing these schemes. It is likely that the schemes will open for applications in early JuneThe Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo announced its cancellation in 2021 on 18 May as a result of the financial risks involved in delivering an event of such scale without the backing of UK-wide commercial COVID-related insurance for events, which remains a reserved matter.

We are therefore exploring options to allow private sector testing to be used for people arriving in Scotland, provided we can ensure the swift and accurate flow of data to Public Health Scotland.",442,461

The group advises on issues and identifies solutions and actions for all partners. Organisations represented on the group include BEMIS, the African Council, Scottish Refugee Council and the Ethnic Minority Resilience Network.We have provided over £100,000 to a range of organisations working with minority ethnic communities to help inform and promote the programme. Activities undertaken include the facilitation of focus groups, provision of translations, hosting awareness-raising events and the development of tailored resources for certain communities.In April 2021 the national programme team produced inclusive planning and delivery criteria to help address barriers for specific groups within health board populations. This is based on the Health Inequality Impact Assessment, research by Voluntary Health Scotland and health board plans. Scottish Government officials meet regularly with Health Boards to discuss inclusion, local challenges and actions that are being undertaken to reach communities with low uptake of the vaccine.Work has also been undertaken to respond to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in certain areas by accelerating the vaccination rollout and through assertive outreach in communities with large ethnic minority populations. For example, in the south of Glasgow, an additional Vaccination Centre was set up rapidly at the Glasgow Central Mosque on 18 May 2021. Mobile clinics continue to be deployed into communities offering drop-in opportunities at venues such as the Glasgow Gurdwara. Discussions are also underway with community leaders of African descent to ensure we are reaching these groups with appropriately tailored communications and delivery.The national Roll Up Your Sleeves campaign phase 2 launched on 20 April 2021 and the TV advert cast and creative reflects Scotland’s diverse society. Our national communications plan includes the production of translated assets in a range of community languages. The QR code on vaccination appointment letters and COVID-19 vaccination leaflets support people to access the information in a format or language of their choice.Scotland’s COVID-19 Vaccine Deployment Plan 2021  provides further details about our approach to the national COVID-19 programme to date and includes examples of partnership work, local outreach and communications undertaken.",443,461

This means that land managers need to apply to NatureScot for consent to release gamebirds within the boundaries of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), where this may have an impact on the special features of nature conservation interest on the site. If the SSSI overlaps with a Natura site (which can be either a Special Protection Area or a Special Area of Conservation), NatureScot must carry out a Habitats Regulations Appraisal before consent can be given.NatureScot’s Site Condition Monitoring Programme measures the health of the notified features across all of Scotland’s protected areas, including European sites. The Programme also identifies underlying causes for unfavourable condition of features in order to inform management actions. Gamebirds are mentioned in around 0.2% of these assessments and gamebird releases have not been identified as the cause of any features on protected sites being in unfavourable condition.",445,461

The organisations on the National Qualifications Group agreed the model for this year, which has been co-produced by them, and is the fairest possible approach for our young people in the challenging circumstances resulting from the pandemic.SQA carried out a public consultation on proposed modification to the assessment of National Courses. They received over 20,000 responses and as a result introduced reductions to the assessment of all National Courses to take account of learning disruption, whilst still maintaining the credibility of the qualifications for learners and end users. Within that context, SQA has provided subject-specific guidance documents for National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher courses. These documents support teachers and lecturers in gathering key assessment evidence as the basis for provisional results. The documents also give guidance on the modifications that were made to courses, after public consultation, to streamline requirements to support teachers and learners and mitigate the impact of disruption.The unavoidable second period of remote learning due to the pandemic has unfortunately meant that assessments are taking place over a shorter period than was first anticipated.To help address this, the framework allows for a significant degree of local flexibility in which assessment tools are used in ways and at times which suit local circumstances and the specific needs of learners.The deadline for submission of provisional grades has been extended to 25 June 2021 to allow for teaching and learning to be completed and to provide a longer opportunity for the gathering of assessment evidence.The National Qualifications 2021 Group has been very clear that certification must be based on demonstrated attainment.",447,461

",2021-05-20,,Answered by Tom Ar,"The Business Rates Incentivisation Scheme (BRIS) was introduced in in 2012-13 in recognition of the fact that the Scottish Government guarantees the combined General Revenue Grant (GRG) and distributable Non-Domestic Rates Income (NDRI) funding thereby reducing the incentive for local authorities to try and maximise their NDRI. The BRIS is focussed on incentivising local authorities to maximise their existing NDRI and also to grow their local business tax base. This is achieved by the Scottish Government setting annual locally based targets. All local authorities that exceed their annual target retain half the extra income achieved from growth in their tax base until the next NDR revaluation assuming they maintain the extra income in the subsequent years. The amounts to be retained are calculated from local authorities’ audited annual non domestic rates returns.

In addition to our work with the airports, the Scottish Government also has regular engagement with airlines.

We recognise the challenges facing authorities in balancing their need to meet a wide range of statutory duties, local priorities and local circumstances.Tables 1 and 2 shows gross revenue expenditure on additional support for learning (ASL) education from 2019-20 and 2018-19 respectively, split by Pre-Primary, Primary, Secondary and Special Education.Table 1 – 2019-20 ASL expenditure by Local Authority (£000)&nbsp;Pre-Primary EducationPrimary EducationSecondary EducationSpecial EducationTotalAberdeen City06,8195,96211,06623,847Aberdeenshire00035,30635,306Angus00010,82410,824Argyll &amp; Bute5983,5394,0342,69010,861City of Edinburgh04135,07235,077Clackmannanshire0008,4348,434Dumfries &amp; Galloway00019,56019,560Dundee City1743,9231,8197,50113,417East Ayrshire00019,23919,239East Dunbartonshire2021,9391,78911,81315,743East Lothian762,8702,0509,56314,559East Renfrewshire5821,4971,2557,96511,299Falkirk00023,38623,386Fife00036,81736,817Glasgow City4,09016,73214,93971,732107,493Highland00038,26538,265Inverclyde2060010,79911,005Midlothian363,1972,23411,30316,770Moray00014,00914,009Na h-Eileanan Siar0004,9454,945North Ayrshire00014,65514,655North Lanarkshire51512,6515,59131,60750,364Orkney Islands01,4701,3061,2294,005Perth &amp; Kinross2762,1951,46813,34017,279Renfrewshire1,1032,8405,28315,34324,569Scottish Borders00011,16311,163Shetland Islands0006,7796,779South Ayrshire00018,03418,034South Lanarkshire4377,9938,29118,06634,787Stirling731,2402,3577,41311,083West Dunbartonshire4072,8362,21912,42717,889West Lothian00022,43222,432All Local Authorities8,77571,74560,598562,777703,895Source: Local Financial Returns – Education (LFR 01) statistical return provided by local authorities to the Scottish Government.Table 2 – 2018-19 ASL expenditure by Local Authority (£000)&nbsp;Pre-Primary EducationPrimary EducationSecondary EducationSpecial EducationTotalAberdeen City08,7754,11010,21623,101Aberdeenshire00033,97033,970Angus0009,0659,065Argyll &amp; Bute5443,2223,6732,5539,992City of Edinburgh05436,86936,878Clackmannanshire0008,6498,649Dumfries &amp; Galloway00018,61718,617Dundee City2113,6331,7016,70012,245East Ayrshire00014,82714,827East Dunbartonshire1231,7981,57310,70314,197East Lothian02,7861,9908,93013,706East Renfrewshire4352,0571,4267,16311,081Falkirk00020,49220,492Fife00034,49734,497Glasgow City3,18315,48913,73165,44597,848Highland00040,94140,941Inverclyde201009,3869,587Midlothian323,2812,09710,89316,303Moray00013,51813,518Na h-Eileanan Siar0004,7724,772North Ayrshire00014,17714,177North Lanarkshire55611,3385,19229,32146,407Orkney Islands101,2991,0531,6864,048Perth &amp; Kinross2571,9611,19412,60216,014Renfrewshire1,1193,6383,24614,88922,892Scottish Borders00010,97910,979Shetland Islands0006,0966,096South Ayrshire00015,68715,687South Lanarkshire5508,3718,70318,92536,549Stirling731,1841,9457,67310,875West Dunbartonshire3972,7171,47011,59216,176West Lothian00020,58720,587All Local Authorities7,69171,55453,108532,420664,773Source: Local Financial Returns – Education (LFR 01) statistical return provided by local authorities to the Scottish Government.All figures in tables 1 and 2 are based on gross expenditure on a funding basis.

This past year has been highly challenging for our young people who have had to stay away from family members living in other households, including grandparents. We have made significant progress in suppressing the virus and vaccinating a growing proportion of the population over the last few months, but the virus has not gone away and we remain at risk from new, more transmissible variants which may become resistant to the vaccines. The Scottish Government’s approach is that only children under 12 years old do not count towards numbers indoors and outdoors, although they do count towards the number of households indoors. Close contact does still carry risks especially if it is indoors and amongst large groups of adults from multiple households. In recognition of the effects on young people’s health and wellbeing, the Scottish Government has allowed 4 12-17 year olds from 4 different households to meet outdoors in Level 4, increasing to 6 people (including 12-17 year olds) from 6 households in Level 3, 8 people from 8 households in Level 2 and this will increase to 12 people from 12 households in Level 1.

This guidance, ‘Open with Care: resuming meaningful contact with care home residents’ was published on 24 February:  Open with Care - supporting meaningful contact in care homes: guidance - gov.scot (www.gov.scot)  .In addition to its focus on the reintroduction of indoor meaningful contact, the guidance also recommends that outdoor visits, including garden and window visits, are supported by care homes. Outdoor visits should not be viewed as replacements to or substitutes for indoor visiting.Outdoor visits (including window visits) can take place either within or outside the care home grounds. Care homes can increase the frequency and duration of visits away from the care home as they assess it is safe to do so, taking advice from local oversight arrangements as necessary. Those meeting up with residents outdoors do not need to be the same two designated visitors as for indoor visits. As outlined in Section 5.1 of the Open with Care guidance, limits on group sizes should be in line with national Covid-19 restrictions for the general public.On 17 May 2021, the Scottish Government published additional guidance on outings: ‘  Open with Care: activities and outings away from the care home ’  .The general principle of the guidance is that, when a resident wishes to go on outings away from the care home, the presumption should be that these should take place in line with general population COVID-19 restrictions/ permissions relevant to the local area, unless there is clear evidence justifying a more restrictive approach.Outings away from the care home will, for many, be a significant positive change. However, we must not become complacent. Outings must be carefully planned, taking account of individual needs, preferences and local conditions. Local oversight teams play a key role in supporting care homes to facilitate safe outings.Support for essential visits is unaffected, which should always be compassionately and generously enabled by care homes when needed.The Open With Care National Oversight Group is monitoring implementation of the guidance, identifying any additional support that might be required, and will report on progress in early June.",456,461

Any decision on whether a patient is ready for discharge is a clinical one, made by the clinician in charge. Where someone is most appropriately cared for after discharge is based on a multi-disciplinary assessment involving the individual and their family carers. In cases where a patient lacks capacity, an appointed guardian or carer with power of attorney, will be involved. If somebody is discharged to a care home it is because that has been assessed as the best place to meet their needs.In March 2020 the Scottish Government issued guidance which stated that prior to people being admitted to a care home whether from hospital or the community, clinical screening should be undertaken of patients alongside a risk assessment to ensure sufficient resources including appropriate isolation facilities are available within the care home to support social distancing and isolation. The guidance recommended all admissions to be isolated for 7 days and if known to have contact with COVID patients for 14 days. Both clinical decisions around discharge and risk assessments are undertaken locally by health and social care professionals. There is no involvement of Scottish Ministers.On 21 April 2020 the then Health Secretary announced that all admissions to care homes from hospital should have a negative test for COVID-19 prior to admission to the home, regardless of symptoms unless it is in the clinical interests of the patient to be moved, and then only after a full risk assessment. Where a patient has tested positive for Covid two negative tests are required. This policy is reflected in both Scottish Government and Health Protection Scotland guidance for care homes.On 28 October 2020 Public Health Scotland published analysis of discharges to care homes between 1 March and 31 May 2020.

This evidence-based guidance advises that the single greatest risk of mortality from COVID-19 is increasing age, and that the risk increases exponentially with age.The Scottish Government greatly values the work of Scotland’s police officers and staff in keeping communities safe throughout this pandemic. They have been at the frontline of this public health response, and we are so grateful for the work they have undertaken.Decisions to prioritise one population group over another are not taken lightly, nor are they straightforward. That is why our prioritisation decisions are guided by the independent expert advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).We are adhering to the priority list devised by the JCVI which has been designed to target those at greatest risk from COVID-19 and is estimated to address over 90 per cent of preventable mortality from the virus in Scotland. This is the priority rollout all nations of the UK are working towards and it is important that we adhere to these lists in order to avoid more lives being lost.",460,461
